My js+svg take on a gif made by @beesandbombs

---

Inspired by the [@beesandbombs](https://twitter.com/beesandbombs) gif posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/hqq4zo/how_do_i_make_this_with_css_js_obviously/) on reddit, I tried to replicate the same effect without using any external library, just an svg animated by vanilla js!
